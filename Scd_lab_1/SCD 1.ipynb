    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the most popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. Python is used for machine learning, data science as well as software development. It offers a wide variety of libraries related to machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a mature programming language, it also has excellent properties for newbie programmers, making it ideal for people who have never programmed before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most remarkable properties of Python are as follow;\n",
    "1. Easy to read code\n",
    "2. Suppression of non-mandatory delimiters\n",
    "3. Python uses indentation to define scope\n",
    "4. Dynamic typed, and dynamic memory usage (Both memory allocation and garbage collection).\n",
    "5. Python is an interpreted language\n",
    "6. Python can be run on interactive consoles (Jupyter notebook, IPython) \n",
    "7. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc)\n",
    "8. Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language and allows developers to write programs with fewer lines."

    "\n",
    "#### **Thread Safety:**\n",
    "- **Immutable types**: Are inherently thread-safe because they can't be modified after creation. This prevents issues like race conditions in a multi-threaded environment, where multiple threads might attempt to modify the same object simultaneously.\n",
    "- **Mutable types**: When shared across threads, need to be handled with care (e.g., using locks) to avoid unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Side Effects and Function Design:**\n",
    "- **Immutability**: Helps avoid unintended side effects in function calls. When passing an immutable type to a function, you can be certain that the function cannot alter the original data.\n",
    "- **Mutable types**: Allow a function to modify data outside its local scope, which may introduce bugs if not managed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Mutable or Immutable Types?\n",

    "- **Immutable Types**: Use them when:\n",
    "  - You want to ensure data consistency and avoid unintended changes.\n",

    "  - You are optimizing for thread safety or memory usage.\n",

    "2. Poorly named variables and functions.\n",
    "3. Complex or convoluted logic.\n",

    "When a programmer encounters messy code written by someone else, it can slow them down significantly for a few reasons:\n",

    "### Longer Learning Curve:\n",
    "- It takes more time to understand the messy code because it isn't intuitive. You have to spend extra effort deciphering what the code is doing.\n",

    "## Simple Rules for Creating Good Names\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use Intention-Revealing Names\n",
    "Names should clearly communicate the purpose of the variable, function, or class.\n",
    "- **Example:** `days_until_expiration` is better than `dte`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Avoid Disinformation\n",
    "Names should not mislead or confuse the reader by implying something they don’t mean.\n",
    "- **Example:** Avoid using `accountList` if it’s not a list but a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Make Meaningful Distinctions\n",
    "Names should be distinct and convey differences in intent or purpose.\n",
    "- **Example:** Instead of using names like `tempData` and `tempData1` for different data processing tasks, use more descriptive names like `userInputData` and `processedUserData`. This helps to clearly differentiate between the data representing raw user input and the data that has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Pronounceable Names\n",
    "Names should be easy to say and communicate verbally.\n",
    "- **Example:** `customerOrder` is better than `custOrd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use Searchable Names\n",
    "Names should be easily searchable in the codebase.\n",
    "- **Example:** `errorCode` is more searchable than `e`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Avoid Encodings (Hungarian Notation)\n",
    "Do not use type prefixes or suffixes that add unnecessary complexity to the name.\n",
    "- **Example:** `firstName` is better than `strFirstName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Don’t Be Cute\n",
    "Names should be professional and descriptive, not playful or quirky.\n",
    "- **Example:** `totalSum` is better than `bigMoney`.\n"

    "# Hungarian Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hungarian Notation is a naming convention in programming where the name of a variable indicates its type or purpose by prefixing it with a set of letters. This system was originally developed by Charles Simonyi, a Hungarian programmer, and was used to help convey the type or purpose of a variable at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts of Hungarian Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Type Prefixes**\n",
    "The notation involves using prefixes in variable names to indicate the type of the variable. For example:\n",
    "- `strName` for a string variable\n",
    "- `intAge` for an integer variable\n",
    "- `btnSubmit` for a button control\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose Prefixes**\n",
    "In addition to type, Hungarian Notation can use prefixes to indicate the purpose of the variable:\n",
    "- `btn` for button controls\n",
    "- `txt` for text boxes\n",
    "- `lbl` for labels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Type-Based Prefixes:**\n",
    "- `strFirstName` — Indicates a string variable holding a first name.\n",
    "- `intCount` — Indicates an integer variable for counting.\n",
    "- `dblPrice` — Indicates a double (floating-point) variable for price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose-Based Prefixes:**\n",
    "- `btnSubmit` — Indicates a button used for submission.\n",
    "- `txtUsername` — Indicates a text box for entering a username.\n",
    "- `lblStatus` — Indicates a label showing status information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pros:**\n",
    "- **Immediate Type Information**: Provides quick information about the variable's type, which can be helpful in languages with weak or no type enforcement.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Helps maintain consistency in variable naming across large codebases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cons:**\n",
    "- **Redundancy**: In modern strongly-typed languages, the type is often clear from the variable's declaration, making the prefix redundant.\n",
    "- **Readability**: Can reduce readability by adding unnecessary complexity to variable names.\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: Changes in data types require updates to variable names, which can be cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modern Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Hungarian Notation is less common in modern programming practices, especially in strongly-typed languages like Python, Java, and C#, where type information is often inferred or clearly defined by the language’s syntax. However, understanding Hungarian Notation can still be valuable for reading and maintaining legacy codebases where it is used.\n"
